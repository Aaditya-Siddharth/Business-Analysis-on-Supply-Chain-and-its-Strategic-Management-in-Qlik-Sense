# DataCo Supply Chain Analysis Project: Informations

      # Overview
      
      This project utilizes Qlik Sense to perform an in-depth analysis of DataCo's supply chain. The goal is to provide actionable insights into sales performance, geographical trends, product and customer analysis, and delivery metrics. By harnessing the power of Qlik Sense, this project transforms raw data into valuable business intelligence, supporting DataCo's strategic decision-making and operational optimization.
      
      # Project Objectives
      
      The primary objectives of this project are to:
      
      1. Analyze Sales Performance: Assess monthly sales trends, overall sales, profit margins, and average order values.
      2. Conduct Geographical Analysis: Evaluate sales distribution across different regions and countries to identify high-performing and underperforming areas.
      3. Perform Product and Customer Analysis: Investigate product contributions to sales, customer purchasing patterns, and product performance.
      4. Assess Delivery Metrics and Customer Behavior: Measure delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and behavior to enhance service quality and customer engagement.
      
      # Key Features
      
      # Interactive Dashboards
      Four main dashboards have been developed, each focusing on different aspects of the supply chain:
      
      1. Sales Analysis Dashboard: Line charts for monthly sales trends, KPIs for sales and profit metrics.
      2. Geographical Analysis Dashboard: Map charts for country-wise sales, bar charts for regional order values.
      3. Product and Customer Analysis Dashboard: Tree maps for product contributions, combo charts for orders and sales by category.
      4. Delivery and Customer Behavior Dashboard: Scatter plots for profit per sales per country, line charts for delivery performance.
      
      # Dynamic Filters
      Implemented filters to allow users to customize their analysis, including:
      
      1. Time Filters: Month and year.
      2. Geographical Filters: Order country.
      3. Market Filters: Market segment.
      4. Comprehensive Visualizations
      
      # Utilized a variety of visualization tools in Qlik Sense, such as:
      
      1.Line Charts: To view sales trends over time.
      2.Pie Charts: To analyze categorical contributions to overall sales.
      3.KPIs: To showcase key metrics like total sales, profit, and average order value.
      4.Map Charts: To represent country-wise sales distribution.
      5.Bar Charts: To view order values by region.
      6.Scatter Plots: To measure profit per sale by country.
      7.Tree Maps: To analyze product contribution to sales.
      8.Combo Charts: To measure the number of orders and sales by category.
      
      # Data Preparation
      Data Collection
      Data was imported from CSV files, covering transactional details, inventory updates, sales metrics, and customer insights.
      
      # Data Preparation and Pre-Processing
      
      1.Value Transformation: Converted binary values (0s and 1s) into meaningful text for better clarity.
      2.Calculated Fields: Created new fields to determine profit/loss per sale, separate month and year from order dates, and assess delivery timeliness.
      3.Data Cleaning: Ensured data consistency and accuracy for reliable analysis.
      
      # Report Generation
      While Qlik Sense offers an automated report generation feature requiring a subscription, I utilized its PDF generation feature. This allowed me to convert visualizations and dashboards into comprehensive PDF reports, which were compiled into a structured document for stakeholders. The final report provides a detailed summary of the analysis and is available via the link below.
      
      # Stories with Qlik Sense
      Created a Qlik Sense story with six slides, each presenting key insights:
      
      1.Sales Performance
      2.Geographical Analysis
      3.Sales Department Analysis
      4.Product Analysis
      5.Delivery Model and Customer Analysis
      6.Supply Chain Analysis
      7.Performance Testing
      8.Amount of Data Loaded
      
      # Processed a substantial dataset from multiple CSV files, including:
      
      1.Transactional Data: Sales transactions details.
      2.Inventory Data: Stock levels and movements.
      3.Sales Data: Metrics by region, category, and product.
      4.Customer Data: Purchase frequency and delivery feedback.
      
      # Utilization of Filters
      Implemented filters for customized data views, including month, year, order country, and market segment, enabling detailed and precise analysis.
      
      
      This project effectively demonstrates the capabilities of Qlik Sense in transforming large datasets into insightful, actionable business intelligence. The interactive dashboards and detailed reports created have equipped DataCo with the necessary tools to optimize their supply chain operations and maintain a competitive edge.
